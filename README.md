the twitter data every few hours would say broken pipe error, kept having to manually start it up again adjusting the loop so wouldnt overwrite. not a hard process but rquiered me to constantly check in on the code and see if it was going or not going. after few days of doing this i ended up stopping where the data was at the end of Feb 2020. My counts are very low because of that but learned a lot process-wise about github and such
